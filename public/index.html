    <p> This is my attempt to set up a website where my cousin and I can
        play toroidal chess over the internet. This app is currently in its
        primitive stages. As such, when a user connects, their user number will
         be displayed below. If your user number is 1, you can play as white. If your
        user number is 2, you can play as black. If your user number is any other number,
        you can't play, but you can watch. Also, white can only start
        making moves once player 2 has connected. In the future I might make this more sophisticated,
      such as adding support for multiple users at once, nicknames, chat, etc. </p>
