    <p> This is my attempt to set up a website where my cousin and I can
        play toroidal chess over the internet. This app is currently in its
        primitive stages. When you connect, you will be put in a room. If there
        is another player in the room, you can begin playing immediately.
        If not, you must wait for another player to join the room before
        you can start making moves.  In the future I might make this more sophisticated,
      such as adding support for choosing your own room, nicknames, chat, etc. </p>
